The StoryBloom Project - Building Joyful Interactions for Shared Wonder.

# The Giving Tree Interactive Demo

This project is an interactive demo built using **Vite**, **React**, **TypeScript**, **Supabase**, and the **OpenAI API**. Users can flip through a virtual book, answer questions, and generate follow-up questions via GPT 4o-mini, and review their responses via Supabase.

---

## Features
- **Book Navigation**: Users can navigate the book using 'next' and 'prev' buttons, along with through a menu that separates the book into 5 thought segments.
- **Interactive Questions**: Each segment contains thought-provoking questions related to the content of the book which parents can use to ask their children.
- **Follow-Up Questions**: Parents can type their child's answer into an input box and generate deeper follow-up questions using OpenAI GPT.
- **Data Storage**: Store all chat interactions in a Supabase database.
